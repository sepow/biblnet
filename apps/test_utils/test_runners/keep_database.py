    tables are flushed and fixtures loaded between tests as per usual
    but if your schema has not changed then this saves significant amounts of time
    and speeds up the test cycle

    Run the unit tests for all the test labels in the provided list.
    Labels must be of the form:
     - app.TestClass.test_method
        Run a single specific test method
     - app.TestClass
        Run all the test methods in a given class
     - app
        Search for doctests and unittests in the named application.

    When looking for tests, the test runner will look in the models and
    tests modules for the application.

    A list of 'extra' tests may also be provided; these tests
    will be added to the test suite.
