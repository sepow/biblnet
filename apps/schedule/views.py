    Context Variables

    ``date``
        This was the date that was generated from the query string.

    ``periods``
        this is a dictionary that returns the periods from the list you passed
        in.  If you passed in Month and Day, then your dictionary would look
        like this

        {

            'day':   <schedule.periods.Day object>
        }

        So in the template to access the Day period in the context you simply
        use ``periods.day``.

    ``calendar``
        This is the Calendar that is designated by the ``calendar_slug``.

    ``weekday_names``
        This is for convenience. It returns the local names of weekedays for
        internationalization.
